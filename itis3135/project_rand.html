                    I intend to have dynamic functionality on multiple pages.

                <p>
                    The Swimming Basics page will have an image/video gallery for each stroke explaining the different movements for each stroke.
                    I want to have a gallery for each stroke because that way I can explain the basics of each stroke using pictures and the user may find it more helpful than a block of text.

                    The Contact Us page will also have a form that can allow a user to send an email directly to the client. 
                    I want to have this functionality because I think a page that is dedicated to contacting the client should have some form of sending an email directly to the client.
