                <h3>Good Website: <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/" target = "_blank" >Khan Academy</a></h3>
                <p>Khan Academy is a non-profit organization that is focused on educating students through free online tools.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: Khan Academy has many different colors that are easy on the eyes and are very attractive to look at. They also have lots of images and shapes that are different sizes in order to draw attention without losing it's charm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: The signature color 'Green' has been repeated many times throughout the website. It is a nice green that is all over the website from small icons to underlines in text. The green is easy on the eyes but also very prominent throughout the website.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: The text aligns properly and is connected via invisible lines. It is very clear where the next header will be and it is also very obvious that all the images are also aligned properly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: The website clearly has sections that make sense together. It is clear that as you scroll down the main page, it will tell you to click on different buttons depending on who you are (student, teacher, etc). Everything is in proper proximity to one another and the grouping makes perfect sense.</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h3>Bad Website: <a href = "https://charlotte.craigslist.org/" target = "_blank" >Craigslist</a></h3>
                <p>Craigslist is an advertisement website that is used by people who are trying to sell different products.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: There are absolutely no interesting colors that are easy on the eyes. It is just one bland page with literally nothing interesting that will draw the attention of the user.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: There is a lot of repetition...wayyyy too much repetition. Every link is the same dark blue and there is no background color other than white and everything is plain and bland and the whole thing makes me feel tired just writing about it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: Lots of headings are not aligned properly in the center of the screen. The links on the left are aligned in a weird way that makes everything a bit harder to read and not good to look at. All the headings in the middle section (for sale, services, etc) do not line up properly and it feels very off and not aligned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: Everything is too close to one another. There is barely enough space in between the headings of the sections and the links. There is barely any space between the the left side with the calendar and the middle portion with the links, making it feel very cramped and hard to look at.</li>
                </ul>
