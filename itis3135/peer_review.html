            <ul>
                <li>The website probably does not need validation buttons...but for now it is probably ok just to make sure that everything is correct</li>
                <li>I feel like the background color is too dark for this kind of text. I find it a little difficult to read small text of that color on a grey background like that. It could also be a font size problem.</li>
                <li>For the Satan Interview, I think it would be easier for the reader if the people on the left were bolded. (Example) <strong>Brian: </strong>This is pretty much the end of our touring for this album.</li>
                <li>In the footer you could put something like "Designed by Chris Kells"</li>
                <li>For the Top 10 metal albums, you could do some sort of slideshow similar to the slideshow assignment where the user can click through one by one and see each album one by one instead of scrolling a lot</li>
                <li>For the Top 10 metal albums, the underlines for each of the album names looks really odd, especially because they are not links</li>
                <li>For the dates on each of the pages you could italicize them so that they stand out a bit</li>
                <li>The website follows most of the criteria for the <strong>CRAP Principles</strong> but I think the contrast could be slightly improved</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So far it is a really impressive start!</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The image on the homepage is 1024 x 597 but it should be scaled down to 512 x 250 in an image editor, not with css or html</li>
                <li>There should be more than 1 page and the homepage should have more than just one image</li>
                <li>So far I like the idea of the website and I think it has a lot of potential but there needs to be more on the website to evaluate it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keep working on it and I will make sure to update this review as things get added later on. Keep up the good work!</p>
