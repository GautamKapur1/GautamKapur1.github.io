            <ul>
                <p><strong>Personal Background: </strong>Born in Michigan but I have lived most of my life in North Carolina.

                <p><strong>Academic Background: </strong>I graduated from Providence High School and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I am also planning to pursue a minor in Psychology.</p>
                <p><strong>Background in this Subject: </strong>I took a few AP programming classes in High School and a large chunk of my courses in college are related to programming and software. I also worked as a marketing intern for Lumaverse Technologies.</p>

                <p><strong>Courses I am taking and why: </strong></p>

                        <li><strong>ITIS 3135</strong> - Web-Based Application Design and Development: This class fulfills a requirement for my software engineering concentration and I would like to learn how to build applications using HTML and other web-based languages.</li>
                        <li><strong>ITIS 3310</strong> - Software Arch & Design: This class fulfills a requirement for my software engineering concentration and I am also interested in software design.</li>

                        <li><strong>PSYC 2120</strong> - Child Psychology: Once I declare a psychology minor, this class will fulfill the Development requirement for that minor. I have worked with kids in the past so I thought this class would be really interesting.</li>
