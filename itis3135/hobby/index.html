                    I have played chess since I was 6 years old and I have never stopped playing since. My dad got me into it because he thought that I should have something 
                    that is fun to play but is also challenging for the mind.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chess has played a major role in my life and I have made lifelong relationships as a result of it.

                    In 2016, my family went with my cousins from India to Switzerland for a few weeks. We had a lot of fun doing different activities there but this was my favorite memory from that trip.

                    While the others were shopping, my dad and I came across some people playing chess on a huge board with giant pieces. It looked so fun to play so I played the winner of that match (the man in the red with the umbrella). 
                    The game got intense and it had attracted a huge crowd of people by the time we were done. The game ended in a draw.

                    My dad signed me up for chess lessons by a man named Mr. Bernard. He was a great chess teacher and he ended up teaching me for about 7 years until I moved away.

                <p>
                    After I moved, I started going to the Charlotte Chess Center, where I played chess with high rated players and learned from them.
