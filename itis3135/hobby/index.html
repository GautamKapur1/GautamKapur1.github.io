                    I have played chess since I was 6 years old and I have never stopped playing since. My dad got me into it because he thought that I should have something 
                    that is fun to play but is also challenging for the mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chess has played a major role in my life and I have made lifelong relationships as a result of it.
